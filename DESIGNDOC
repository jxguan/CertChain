Overall Workflow:
 - Registrar issues transcript, student receives the link and the raw data.
 - When student applies for a job, the student provides the link or the raw
   data.
 - The company would go to a third party website and enter the link or upload
   the raw data, then, a fully rendered pdf is shown.

Third Party should behave like a normal peer except that it never signs or asks
other peers to sign documents. It only keeps a replica of the HashChains of
other peers.
